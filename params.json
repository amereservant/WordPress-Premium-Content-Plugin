{"name":"Wordpress-post-premium-content","tagline":"Simple WordPress plugin that adds the ability to selectively mark posts as \"Premium Content\" and restrict content viewing to users with Premium Content permissions.","body":"# WordPress Premium Content Plugin\r\nThe goal of the Premium Content Plugin was to provide a _minimalistic_ way of controlling access to content that is meant to be kept private/restricted and limited to those who the author wants to share it with.\r\n\r\nIt is NOT an extensive content control plugin, such as one allowing for subscription services, etc. There's already some of those out there.\r\n\r\nThis is just a simple one allowing an individual to control access to their WordPress website.  It also integrates with the [Blubrry PowerPress](http://create.blubrry.com/resources/powerpress/) podcasting plugin.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Accessing Plugin Settings\r\nThere's a couple of places this plugin allows you to configure/use it, so I figured I'd be kind enough to tell you where those are so there's no \"hidden\" or \"surprise\" places down the road.\r\n\r\n### Settings Page\r\n\r\nThe primary settings page is under the **Users > Premium Content** menu:\r\n\r\nDetails on the settings can be found in the **Help** tab in the upper-right corner.\r\nUser Settings\r\n\r\nUnder \"Edit User\" or \"Edit Your Profile\", you will see a new option called **Premium Content Access**:\r\n\r\nThis option will appear IF the user has the capability _(depending on the value of **Required Capability** option)_ to edit this value.\r\n> NOTE: If the checkbox is greyed out and you cannot change the value, it's because the user's Role(s) are assigned the premium_content capability and this value has no effect.\r\n> If you wish to unassign this permission to the user, go to the Roles section in the plugin options and remove the premium_content from the user's role(s).\r\n### Post/Page Publish Box\r\n\r\nIn the Publish Box, there will be a new option named **Premium Content** _(of course, depending on the user's capacity)_ that will assign the content the Premium Content status.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-10159244-28","note":"Don't delete this file!
